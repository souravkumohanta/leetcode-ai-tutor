# Icons Directory

This directory is for storing the icon files for the LeetCode AI Tutor Chrome extension.

## Required Icons

The extension requires the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Generating Icons

You can generate these icons using the `icons.html` file in the root directory:

1. Open `icons.html` in your browser
2. Click on each icon to download it as a PNG file
3. Save the icons in this directory with the appropriate names

Alternatively, you can create your own icons using an image editor and save them in this directory.
